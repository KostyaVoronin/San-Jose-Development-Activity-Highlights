The San Jose's Department of Planning, Building, and Code Enforcement publishes the Development Activity Highlights and Five-Year Forecast report on an annual basis. The report serves three main functions:
  - Assisting in estimating the future construction-related tax revenues.
  - Providing data for periodic assessment of the rate, type, and location of new developments.
  - Disseminating information on major development projects to the public.

The planning staff provides tabulated data related to recent "major" development projects (residential: 50+ units, commercial: 25,000 sq. ft., industrial: 75,000 sq. ft.)

The development activity data is divided into multiple categories, such as land use categories, project status, location, etc. The data included in the report can be stored in a dataset with ~200 rows (projects) and 8 columns (features: File Number, Address, Planning Area, etc.)

The data provided in the report was further enhanced to include additional details for each project that were collected by using Google Cloud API services, Walk Score API, SJPermits.org, San Jose CA Open Data Portal, and other sources.

The final datasets includes over 50 features for most developments.

Additionally, an interactive map, a lookup tool, and several data visuaizations were created to make it easier to work with the data. These assets are can be found at [Kostya.io](https://kostya.io/portfolio/san-jose-development-activity-highlights).
